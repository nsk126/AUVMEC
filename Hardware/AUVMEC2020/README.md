# Notes for Current PCB v1.0

- 4 Relays JQX-16F(T91), 2 Relays JQX-15F(T90)
- ESC connector bar meant to be placed on the bottom side
- Few of the sitching vias are exposed, hence any possible connector must be kept away
- Buck Regulaters are meant to be placed on the bottom side (err in design)
- Relay signa conn trace width : 0.25mm -> 1.4A @30C increase
- All remaining signal conn trace width : 0.5mm -> 2.3A @30C increase
- Power supply to each thruster trace width : 2.56mm -> 7.57A @30C increase
- Main power supply bus bar trace width : 5.7mm -> 13.5A @30C increase
- 4x Mounting holes dia: 3.2mm
- Jumpers/headers pitch : 2.54mm (common pitch size)
- 1oz/ft^2 board or 35 um copper trace thickness
